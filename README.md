## What is HeartSync?

HeartSync is a simple, beautiful app for two people to stay emotionally connected. When you miss your special someone, just tap the heart button. Every tap is counted, timestamped, and visualized in charts and history.



## About the Developer

Hi, I'm **Pinak** ‚Äî a 21-year-old developer from Rajkot, India.

I build apps that are completely free because I believe culture and connection shouldn't exist only for those who can afford it. HeartSync is made with care for people who want to stay close to the ones they love.

The apps are free, but the food I eat isn't. If this app helps you stay connected, and you can support me ‚Äî even a little ‚Äî it means the world.

If you don't have money, spreading the word is real support too. Share it, tell a friend, leave a star on GitHub.
